    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I bring a strong foundation in web development technologies and a love for
      building user-friendly, responsive websites as a driven and diligent
      junior web developer. I'm proficient in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and
      I've built and maintained web apps by hand. I have a good grasp of
      software development fundamentals thanks to Dr. Angela Yu's bootcamp and
      real-world project experience. I enjoy working with teams from multiple
      departments and do well in a fast-paced, dynamic atmosphere. I'm eager to
      use my creativity, problem-solving, and ongoing learning abilities to
      produce top-notch web solutions and advance as a web development
      professional.
